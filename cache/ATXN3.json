These co-activators acetylate histones, leading to a more open chromatin structure that facilitates gene transcription. ATXN3 directly interacts with p300/CBP.",
        "effect": "Instead of acting as a co-activator, ATXN3 functions as a transcriptional repressor. By binding to p300/CBP, ATXN3 inhibits their intrinsic HAT activity. Furthermore, ATXN3 can recruit histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) to target gene promoters, leading to the removal of acetyl groups from histones, chromatin condensation, and subsequent repression of transcription.",
