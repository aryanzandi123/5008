Primary literature reveals a complex, context-dependent relationship. In cardiac muscle, VCP suppression *activates* mTORC1 signaling, suggesting an inhibitory role for VCP. Conversely, in neuronal models, proper VCP function appears necessary for downstream effects of mTORC1, suggesting a permissive or activating role. The original claim conflated VCP's role in maintaining lysosomal integrity (a prerequisite for mTORC1 activation) with the ultimate downstream signaling outcome, which varies by cell type.",
        "mechanism": "The mTORC1 complex is a central regulator of cell growth and is activated at the lysosomal surface in response to nutrients. VCP is critical for maintaining the integrity and dynamics of the endo-lysosomal system. However, its functional effect on mTORC1 is dichotomous. In cardiac tissue, suppression of VCP leads to an *increase* in mTORC1 activity and phosphorylation of its downstream targets. This suggests an inhibitory or restraining function of VCP on mTORC1 in the heart under physiological and stress conditions. In contrast, in neuronal contexts, VCP mutations are associated with deficits in protein synthesis and dendritic spine formation, which can be rescued by mTORC1 activators like leucine, implying that VCP function is required for proper mTORC1-downstream pathway execution in the nervous system.",
        "effect": "VCP's regulation of mTORC1 is highly context-dependent. In cardiomyocytes, VCP appears to negatively regulate mTORC1, as its suppression leads to pathway activation. In neurons, it appears to be a positive effector, required for mTORC1-dependent processes.",

This RNF8-mediated ubiquitination also recruits the VCP/p97 ATPase complex. VCP then acts as a segregase to remodel the ubiquitinated chromatin, for example, by removing factors like L3MBTL1 that mask histone marks, thereby promoting the recruitment of 53BP1 to activate the repair cascade. Concurrently, the VCP-ATXN3 deubiquitinase complex dynamically regulates RNF8 itself. Under normal conditions, VCP-ATXN3 deubiquitinates and stabilizes RNF8 to maintain a functional protein pool. Following DNA damage, the same VCP-ATXN3 complex extracts RNF8 from chromatin to terminate the signaling response.",

Cdc48 recruitment also requires the Rqc1 subunit of the RQC complex, the exact function of which remains to be elucidated. Cdc48 extracts and delivers the nascent chains to the proteasome for degradation."

These observations, together with nascent-chain interaction analysis, have suggested a model wherein Ltn1 and Rqc2 facilitate nascent-chain ubiquitination. Subsequently, the Cdc48 complex, recruited in part via Rqc1, mediates extraction of ubiquitinated nascent chains from the ribosome for degradation."
