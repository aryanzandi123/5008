The primary literature repeatedly confirms that the regulatory effect of HDAC6 on STAT3 is independent of STAT3's acetylation status. The correct mechanism is that HDAC6 forms a physical complex with STAT3, both in the cytoplasm and nucleus. This interaction is essential to protect STAT3 from dephosphorylation (likely by phosphatases such as PP2A), thereby maintaining STAT3 in its active, phosphorylated state (p-STAT3 Tyr705). This sustained phosphorylation is required for STAT3's recruitment to the promoters of its target genes.",
