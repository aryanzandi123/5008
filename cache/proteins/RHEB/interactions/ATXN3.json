The reality is the opposite: polyubiquitination of RHEB is a positive signal for mTORC1 activation. ATXN3 deubiquitinates RHEB under amino acid starvation to keep mTORC1 OFF. When amino acids are present, ATXN3 is removed from the lysosome, allowing RHEB to be polyubiquitinated, which promotes its binding to and activation of mTORC1. Therefore, ATXN3's activity on RHEB is a negative regulator of mTORC1, but the mechanism described in the input was incorrect.",
