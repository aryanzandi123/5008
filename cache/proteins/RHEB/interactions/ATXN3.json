Under amino acid starvation, ATXN3 is recruited to the lysosome and deubiquitinates RHEB, preventing its interaction with mTORC1. Conversely, amino acid stimulation blocks ATXN3's lysosomal localization, leading to RHEB polyubiquitination, enhanced RHEB-mTORC1 binding, and mTORC1 activation. Therefore, ATXN3's deubiquitination of RHEB is an inhibitory event for mTORC1.",
