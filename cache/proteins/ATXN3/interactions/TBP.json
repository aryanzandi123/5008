The more accurate mechanism is that ATXN3 acts as a transcriptional co-repressor. It binds to promoter regions and recruits a histone deacetylase complex (containing HDAC3 and NCoR), which leads to chromatin condensation and repression of gene expression. TBP, as part of the basal transcription machinery, is prevented from binding to the TATA box in this repressed chromatin state. Therefore, ATXN3's effect on TBP is indirect and inhibitory.",
