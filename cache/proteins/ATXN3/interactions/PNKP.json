PNKP processes damaged DNA termini by removing 3'-phosphate groups (3'-phosphatase activity) and adding 5'-phosphate groups (5'-kinase activity), creating suitable ends for DNA polymerases and ligases to complete single- and double-strand break repair.",

In contrast, polyglutamine-expanded mutant ATXN3 also binds to PNKP but inhibits its enzymatic function. This loss of PNKP activity leads to the accumulation of unrepaired DNA strand breaks, chronic activation of the DNA damage response, and ultimately, apoptosis.",
