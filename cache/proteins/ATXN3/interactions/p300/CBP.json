While ATXN3 does interact with p300/CBP and the outcome is transcriptional repression, the primary mechanism is not direct inhibition of their Histone Acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. Instead, ATXN3 binds to target gene promoters and recruits a corepressor complex, including Histone Deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and the Nuclear Receptor Corepressor (NCoR). This complex actively deacetylates histones, directly counteracting the activity of HATs like p300/CBP and leading to transcriptional repression.",
