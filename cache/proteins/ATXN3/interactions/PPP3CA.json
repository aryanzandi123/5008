However, primary literature (Chou et al., 2008) demonstrates that the relationship is actually TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSION of the PPP3CA gene by ATXN3. ATXN3 does not serve as a substrate for Calcineurin-mediated localization; rather, expanded ATXN3 reduces PPP3CA mRNA and protein levels, leading to cerebellar dysfunction. This is a classic 'Mechanistic Opposite' and 'Contextual Error'.",
