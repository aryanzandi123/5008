The primary literature demonstrates that ATXN3 causes transcriptional repression not by inhibiting a HAT (like CBP), but by actively recruiting a Histone Deacetylase (HDAC3) to gene promoters. The net effect is reduced histone acetylation and gene repression, but the mechanism is via activation of a deacetylating complex.",
