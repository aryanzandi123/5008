Instead, ATXN3 acts as a positive transcriptional regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. The loss of ATXN3 leads to a *decrease* in the expression of Wnt pathway components, thereby depressing the pathway. The effect is promotion of the pathway, but the mechanism is transcriptional, not post-translational stabilization of β-catenin.",
