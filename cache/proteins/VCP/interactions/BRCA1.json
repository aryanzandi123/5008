RNF8, with the E2 enzyme UBC13, catalyzes the formation of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on histones (e.g., H1, H2A). These ubiquitin chains act as a recruitment platform for both VCP and the BRCA1-A complex (via the UIM domains of RAP80). VCP's role at the site is to remodel the ubiquitinated chromatin, which is a necessary step to allow the BRCA1 complex to access the break site and initiate homologous recombination.",

By remodeling RNF8-generated ubiquitin conjugates on chromatin, VCP indirectly promotes the stable recruitment and function of the BRCA1-A complex at DSBs, thereby activating the homologous recombination repair pathway.",

Instead, VCP is recruited to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) as part of a ubiquitin-dependent signaling cascade initiated by the E3 ligase RNF8. RNF8, recruited to DSBs via MDC1, creates K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on histones. These chains serve as a scaffold to recruit downstream factors, including the BRCA1-A complex. While VCP is also recruited in this context and is implicated in chromatin remodeling, the direct trigger for BRCA1-A complex recruitment is the ubiquitin signal generated by RNF8 and amplified by RNF168. Therefore, VCP's role is to facilitate the process by modulating the ubiquitinated chromatin environment, rather than directly activating BRCA1 recruitment.",
