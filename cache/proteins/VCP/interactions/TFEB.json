Wild-type VCP is essential for the recovery phase from this stress, where it facilitates the clearance of damaged lysosomes (lysophagy). By resolving the upstream damage signal, VCP allows for the termination of TFEB activation, leading to TFEB's export from the nucleus and the cessation of its transcriptional program. When VCP function is impaired by mutation or inhibition, damaged lysosomes are not cleared efficiently, leading to a persistent stress signal that causes TFEB to remain active and localized in the nucleus.",
