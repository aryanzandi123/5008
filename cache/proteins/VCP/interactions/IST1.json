IST1 (also known as CHMP8) is an ESCRT-III-associated protein that functions as an adaptor to recruit the disassembly machinery to the ESCRT-III polymer. Specifically, IST1 can recruit Vps4, the canonical ESCRT-III disassemblase. However, literature also shows that IST1 and CHMP1 act together to recruit VCP/p97's functional partner, VPS4, to the midbody during cytokinesis. Therefore, IST1 facilitates the recruitment of the disassembly ATPase (Vps4/VCP) to the ESCRT-III polymer. VCP then acts on the entire complex. The arrow VCP -> IST1 represents VCP's action of disassembling the complex that IST1 is a part of and helps recruit.",
