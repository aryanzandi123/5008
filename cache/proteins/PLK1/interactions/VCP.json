The literature describes a complex regulatory network where AURKB activates PLK1 in early mitosis. However, VCP's action on AURKB occurs in late mitosis to INACTIVATE it. Therefore, VCP's function contributes to the overall shutdown of mitotic signaling, which would indirectly lead to the INHIBITION of PLK1 activity, not its activation. No direct evidence was found for a specific VCP-AURKB-PLK1 signaling module; the link is an inference based on VCP's role in terminating mitotic signaling.",
