The E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF8 is an early responder, recruited by phosphorylated MDC1. RNF8 then ubiquitinates histones, creating a binding site for the downstream E3 ligase RNF168, which amplifies the ubiquitin signal to recruit factors like 53BP1 and BRCA1.",

First, ATXN3 counteracts the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase RNF4, thereby stabilizing MDC1 on the chromatin at DSB sites. This sustained presence of MDC1 is crucial for the efficient initial recruitment of RNF8. Second, the p97-ATXN3 complex stimulates the extraction of RNF8 from chromatin after its initial wave of activity. This turnover of RNF8 is necessary to prevent its hyper-accumulation and to allow for the timely recruitment of RNF168 to amplify the DNA damage signal.",

        "DNA double-strand break (DSB) occurs → ATXN3 counteracts RNF4-mediated ubiquitination of MDC1 → MDC1 is stabilized on chromatin at the DSB → Stabilized MDC1 promotes efficient recruitment of RNF8 → The p97-ATXN3 complex extracts chromatin-bound RNF8, ensuring proper turnover → Timely recruitment of RNF168 is facilitated → RNF168 amplifies ubiquitin signaling on histones → Downstream repair factors (e.g., 53BP1) are recruited → DSB repair is promoted"
