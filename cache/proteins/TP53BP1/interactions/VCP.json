This ubiquitination serves as a recruitment signal for the VCP/p97 ATPase complex. VCP then utilizes its ATPase activity to remodel the chromatin by removing the Polycomb protein L3MBTL1. L3MBTL1 normally binds to the di-methylated lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20me2), a key binding site for 53BP1, thereby masking it. By displacing L3MBTL1, VCP uncovers the H4K20me2 mark, which is then recognized by the tandem Tudor domain of 53BP1, leading to its accumulation at the DSB site to promote non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair.",
