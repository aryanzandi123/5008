The primary literature shows that ATXN3 does not act on the PD-L1 protein itself. Instead, ATXN3 deubiquitinates and stabilizes multiple TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS (including IRF1, STAT3, HIF-2α, and JunB) that are responsible for upregulating the TRANSCRIPTION of the CD274 gene. The effect is an increase in PD-L1 levels, but the mechanism is transcriptional, not post-translational.",
