Primary literature demonstrates that the direct target is Smad3, not Smad7. HDAC6, a cytoplasmic deacetylase, removes acetyl groups from Smad3. This deacetylation promotes Smad3's subsequent phosphorylation and activation by the TGF-β receptor. By activating Smad3, HDAC6 promotes the pro-fibrotic TGF-β signaling pathway. The observed changes in the inhibitory protein Smad7's expression upon HDAC6 inhibition are an indirect, downstream consequence of modulating the entire pathway, not the initiating mechanism. In a different context, Smad7 can act as a transcription factor to increase HDAC6 expression.",
