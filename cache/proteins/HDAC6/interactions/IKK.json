Instead, HDAC6 regulates the NF-κB pathway via two distinct, and potentially opposing, mechanisms depending on cellular context and location. 1) In the nucleus, HDAC6 acts as a transcriptional inhibitor by directly deacetylating the p65/RelA subunit of NF-κB, which reduces its DNA-binding activity. 2) In the cytoplasm, HDAC6's activity is required for the degradation of the inhibitor IκBα, an event which releases and activates NF-κB. Therefore, the net effect of HDAC6 on NF-κB signaling is not simply inhibitory but is highly context-dependent.",
