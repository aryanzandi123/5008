The primary literature indicates that HDAC6 activity predominantly ACTIVATES or supports AKT signaling through two main mechanisms. First, HDAC6 deacetylates the chaperone Hsp90, which is essential for maintaining AKT's stability and function. Second, HDAC6 can directly interact with and deacetylate AKT, a process required for its kinase activity. While some context-dependent inhibitory effects exist (e.g., via PTEN or PP1), the principal, direct, and Hsp90-mediated effects are activating. Inhibition of HDAC6 leads to hyperacetylation of Hsp90, impairing its chaperone function, and hyperacetylation of AKT itself, which reduces its kinase activity.",
