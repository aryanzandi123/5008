Conversely, HDAC6's deacetylase activity on α-tubulin can impair axonal transport, a process that is often compromised in TDP-43 proteinopathies. Pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 can restore transport, correct TDP-43 mislocalization, and reduce insoluble TDP-43 levels.",

HDAC6 is not a simple inhibitor of TDP-43 aggregation, but rather a key component of the cellular protein quality control system with a dual role. On one hand, HDAC6 facilitates the clearance of misfolded, ubiquitinated TDP-43 by promoting its transport to the aggresome for autophagic degradation. In this context, HDAC6 activity reduces TDP-43 aggregate levels. On the other hand, in pathological states (e.g., with TDP-43 mutations), HDAC6 activity can be detrimental by impairing axonal transport through tubulin deacetylation. In these contexts, HDAC6 *inhibition* has been shown to be beneficial, restoring axonal transport, reducing TDP-43 insolubility and cytoplasmic mislocalization.",
