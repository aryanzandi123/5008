By removing ubiquitin chains from Parkin, wild-type ATXN3 stabilizes the E3 ligase and inhibits its activity. Mechanistically, ATXN3 stabilizes the complex between Parkin and its E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, which impedes the efficient transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to Parkin, thereby reducing Parkin's E3 ligase activity.",
