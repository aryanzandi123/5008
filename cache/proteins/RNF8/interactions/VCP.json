Upon DSBs, RNF8 is recruited to sites of damage and generates K63-linked ubiquitin chains on histones, which act as a scaffold to recruit downstream repair factors. This RNF8-mediated ubiquitination also recruits the VCP/p97 ATPase complex. VCP then acts as a segregase to remodel the ubiquitinated chromatin, for example, by removing factors like L3MBTL1 that mask histone marks, thereby promoting the recruitment of 53BP1 to activate the repair cascade. Concurrently, the VCP-ATXN3 deubiquitinase complex dynamically regulates RNF8 itself. Under normal conditions, VCP-ATXN3 deubiquitinates and stabilizes RNF8 to maintain a functional protein pool. Following DNA damage, the same VCP-ATXN3 complex extracts RNF8 from chromatin to terminate the signaling response.",
