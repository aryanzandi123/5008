Primary literature demonstrates a different, more specific mechanism for transcriptional repression. Normal ATXN3 acts as a transcriptional repressor by binding to target gene promoters and recruiting a co-repressor complex containing Histone Deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and Nuclear Receptor Corepressor (NCoR). This complex then removes acetyl groups from histones, leading to a condensed chromatin state and gene silencing. While ATXN3 does interact with HATs like PCAF, its repressive function in this context is executed via histone deacetylation by the recruited HDAC3, not by direct inhibition of PCAF's acetylation activity.",
