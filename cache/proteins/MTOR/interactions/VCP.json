Primary literature reveals a complex, context-dependent relationship. In cardiac muscle, VCP suppression *activates* mTORC1 signaling, suggesting an inhibitory role for VCP. Conversely, in neuronal models, proper VCP function appears necessary for downstream effects of mTORC1, suggesting a permissive or activating role. The original claim conflated VCP's role in maintaining lysosomal integrity (a prerequisite for mTORC1 activation) with the ultimate downstream signaling outcome, which varies by cell type.",
