Following DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), the ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168 generate K48-linked ubiquitin chains on chromatin-associated proteins at the damage site. These ubiquitin chains serve as a recruitment signal for the VCP-Ufd1-Npl4 complex. The ATPase and segregase activity of VCP is then required to remodel the chromatin by extracting ubiquitinated proteins. This action removes factors that may be blocking the site, such as L3MBTL1, thereby facilitating the subsequent recruitment and accumulation of key DNA repair proteins, including BRCA1 and 53BP1, to initiate homologous recombination repair.",
        "effect": "VCP's primary role in this context is to act upstream of BRCA1 by clearing ubiquitinated proteins from sites of DNA damage, which is an essential preparatory step for the recruitment of BRCA1 and the assembly of the DNA repair machinery.",
