HDAC6's interaction with vimentin is involved in the subsequent step of maintaining the collapsed vimentin 'cage' structure around the protein aggregates at the microtubule-organizing center.",

HDAC6 promotes the TGF-β signaling pathway, which in turn leads to the upregulation of Snail2 (Slug), a key transcription factor driving the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). However, the direct repression of E-cadherin by Snail2 involves the recruitment of other HDACs, specifically HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3, not HDAC6, to the E-cadherin promoter.",
        "mechanism": "HDAC6 acts upstream in the TGF-β signaling cascade, which is a potent inducer of the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). HDAC6 activity is required for the activation of the transcription factor SMAD3. Activated SMAD3 then promotes the expression of key EMT-driving transcription factors, including Snail2. Snail2, in turn, acts as a transcriptional repressor of epithelial genes like E-cadherin, a critical step for cells to lose adhesion and gain migratory properties.",
        "effect": "HDAC6 indirectly promotes the function of Snail2 by facilitating the TGF-β signaling pathway that increases Snail2 expression. This leads to the Snail2-mediated transcriptional repression of E-cadherin, which is a hallmark of EMT, resulting in increased cell motility and invasion.",
