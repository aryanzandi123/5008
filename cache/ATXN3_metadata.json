The more accurate mechanism is that ATXN3 acts as a transcriptional co-repressor. It binds to promoter regions and recruits a histone deacetylase complex (containing HDAC3 and NCoR), which leads to chromatin condensation and repression of gene expression. TBP, as part of the basal transcription machinery, is prevented from binding to the TATA box in this repressed chromatin state. Therefore, ATXN3's effect on TBP is indirect and inhibitory.",
        "mechanism": "ATXN3 functions as a transcriptional co-repressor by binding to specific DNA sequences in gene promoters. This binding event serves as a scaffold for the recruitment of a larger repressor complex that includes Histone Deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and the Nuclear Receptor Corepressor (NCoR).",
        "effect": "The recruitment of the HDAC3/NCoR complex by ATXN3 leads to the deacetylation of histone proteins in the vicinity of the gene promoter. This enzymatic modification results in a more compact chromatin structure, which physically obstructs the access of the basal transcriptional machinery, including the TATA-binding protein (TBP), to the DNA. Consequently, the initiation of transcription is inhibited.",
