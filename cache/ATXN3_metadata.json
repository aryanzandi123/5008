        "mechanism_correction": "The input claim is contextually incomplete. ATXN3 deubiquitinates RHEB, which *inhibits* mTORC1 signaling. Under amino acid starvation, ATXN3 is recruited to the lysosome and deubiquitinates RHEB, preventing its interaction with mTORC1. Conversely, amino acid stimulation blocks ATXN3's lysosomal localization, leading to RHEB polyubiquitination, enhanced RHEB-mTORC1 binding, and mTORC1 activation. Therefore, ATXN3's deubiquitination of RHEB is an inhibitory event for mTORC1.",
        "mechanism": "Under conditions of amino acid starvation, the inactive Rag GTPases recruit ATXN3 to the lysosomal surface. There, ATXN3 acts as a deubiquitinase for the small GTPase RHEB, removing polyubiquitin chains. This deubiquitination event reduces the binding affinity of RHEB for mTORC1, thereby inhibiting its kinase activity.",
        "effect": "By deubiquitinating RHEB, ATXN3 suppresses mTORC1 signaling. This effect is overridden by amino acid stimulation, which prevents ATXN3 from localizing to the lysosome, allowing RHEB to become polyubiquitinated and activate mTORC1.",
